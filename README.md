Here above the lanes can be seen highlighted in slight greenish color and cars are boxed in red frame, which shows the detection and eventually the process can be improved by using better edge detection and object detection algorithms though. At now the algorithms doesn't work good on curved paths.

Main algorithms used

1)Hough Line Transform(for lanes detection)

2)HaarCascade Algorithm(For Vehicle detection)
